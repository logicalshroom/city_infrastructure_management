ucture Management System
Objective: The aim of this assignment is to apply the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming in Python to build a simulated City Infrastructure Management System. This system will incorporate classes, objects, methods, and data structures to manage different aspects of a city, such as buildings, traffic, and events.

Task 1: Vehicle Registration System

- Problem Statement: Create a Python class Vehicle with attributes registration_number, type, and owner. Implement a method update_owner to change the vehicle's owner. Then, create a few instances of Vehicle and demonstrate changing the owner.

- Code Example: Provide a basic structure for the Vehicle class without methods.

    class Vehicle:
        def __init__(self, reg_num, type, owner):
            self.registration_number = reg_num
            self.type = type
            self.owner = owner
- Expected Outcome: Completion of the Vehicle class with the update_ownermethod and a demonstration script showing the creation of Vehicle objects and updating their owners.

Task 2: Event Management System Enhancement

- Problem Statement: Extend an existing Event class by adding a feature to keep track of the number of participants. Implement a method add_participant that increases the count and a method get_participant_count to retrieve the current count.

- Code Example: Basic Event class without participant tracking.

    class Event:
        def __init__(self, name, date):
            self.name = name
            self.date = date
